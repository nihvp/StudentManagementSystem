## File Structure

- **Student_details.dat**: Stores student details (ID, name, grade, status).
- **Marks.dat**: Stores student marks for various subjects.
- **StudentManagement.py**: The main Python script containing the program logic.

---

## Code Structure

The program is divided into three main classes:

1. **Student**:
   - Handles student-related operations like adding, updating, deleting, and displaying students.

2. **Marks**:
   - Manages marks for students, including adding, updating, and displaying marks.

3. **Report**:
   - Generates and displays a report card for a student based on their marks.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Add a Student**:
   - Go to **Manage Student List** â†’ **Add Student**.
   - Enter the student's name and grade.

2. **Add Marks**:
   - Go to **Manage Student Marks** â†’ **Add or Update Marks**.
   - Enter the student ID and subject marks.

3. **Generate Report Card**:
   - Go to **Generate Report Card**.
   - Enter the student ID to view their report card.

---

## Notes

- The program uses **pickle** to store data in binary files (`Student_details.dat` and `Marks.dat`). Ensure these files are not manually edited.
- The program supports soft deletion of students. Deleted students are marked as "DELETED" and are not displayed in the student list.
- The report card includes grades calculated based on the total marks obtained by the student.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Implement data validation for inputs (e.g., valid grades, marks within range).
